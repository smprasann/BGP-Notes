BGP-Notes
A comprehensive collection of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) study notes, configurations, and reference materials.
Overview
This repository contains educational materials, study notes, and practical examples for understanding and working with BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) - the routing protocol that makes the Internet work. BGP is the standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.
